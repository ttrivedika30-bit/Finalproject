     * Requests the database changes feed in the same way as `GET /{db}/_changes` does. It is widely used with the

     *
     * ### Note
     *
     * Before using the changes feed read the
     * [FAQs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-changes-feed) to understand the limitations and
     * appropriate use cases.
     *
     * If you need to pass parameters to dynamically change the filtered content use the `_selector` filter type for
     * better performance and compatibility. The SDKs have full support for change requests using selector filters, but
     * don't support passing parameters to design document filters.
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {string} params.db - Path parameter to specify the database name.
     * @param {string[]} [params.docIds] - Schema for a list of document IDs.
     * @param {string[]} [params.fields] - JSON array that uses the field syntax. Use this parameter to specify which
     * fields of a document must be returned. If it is omitted or empty, the entire document is returned.
     * @param {JsonObject} [params.selector] - JSON object describing criteria used to select documents. The selector
     * specifies fields in the document, and provides an expression to evaluate with the field content or other data.
     *
     * The selector object must:
     *   * Be structured as valid JSON.
     *   * Contain a valid query expression.
     *
     * Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
     * option if filtering on document attributes only.
     *
     * Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
     * those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
     *
     * Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
     *
     * There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
     * * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
     * combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
     * * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
     * instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the supplied
     * argument.
     *
     * It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
     * * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the basis
     * of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
     * * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query selectors
     * use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce the number
     * of documents that will need to be scanned.
     *
     * See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
     * combination and conditional operators.
     *
     * For further reference see [selector syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntax).
     * @param {string} [params.lastEventId] - Header parameter to specify the ID of the last events received by the server
     * on a previous connection. Overrides `since` query parameter.
     * @param {boolean} [params.attEncodingInfo] - Query parameter to specify whether to include the encoding information
     * in attachment stubs if the particular attachment is compressed.
     * @param {boolean} [params.attachments] - Query parameter to specify whether to include attachments bodies in a
     * response.
     * @param {boolean} [params.conflicts] - Query parameter to specify whether to include a list of conflicted revisions
     * in each returned document. Active only when `include_docs` is `true`.
     * @param {boolean} [params.descending] - Query parameter to specify whether to return the documents in descending by
     * key order.
     * @param {string} [params.feed] - Query parameter to specify the changes feed type.
     * @param {string} [params.filter] - Query parameter to specify a filter to emit only specific events from the changes
     * stream.
     *
     * The built-in filter types are:
     *   * `_design` - Returns only changes to design documents.
     *   * `_doc_ids` - Returns changes for documents with an ID matching one specified in
     *       `doc_ids` request body parameter. (`POST` only)
     *   * `_selector` - Returns changes for documents that match the `selector`
     *       request body parameter. The selector syntax is the same as used for
     *       `_find`. (`POST` only)
     *   * `_view` - Returns changes for documents that match an existing map
     *       function in the view specified by the query parameter `view`.
     *
     * Additionally, the value can be the name of a JS filter function from a design document. For example:
     * `design_doc/filtername`.
     *
     * **Note:** For better performance use the built-in `_selector`, `_design` or `_doc_ids` filters rather than JS based
     * `_view` or design document filters. If you need to pass values to change the filtered content use the `_selector`
     * filter type.

     * documents in the response.
     * @param {number} [params.limit] - Query parameter to specify the number of returned documents to limit the result
     * to.
     * @param {number} [params.seqInterval] - Query parameter to specify that the update seq should only be calculated
     * with every Nth result returned. When fetching changes in a batch, setting <code>seq_interval=&lt;batch
     * size&gt;</code>, where &lt;batch size&gt; is the number of results requested per batch, load can be reduced on the
     * source database as computing the seq value across many shards (especially in highly-sharded databases) is
     * expensive.
     * @param {string} [params.since] - Query parameter to specify to start the results from the change immediately after
     * the given update sequence. Can be a valid update sequence or `now` value. Default is `0` i.e. all changes.
     * @param {string} [params.style] - Query parameter to specify how many revisions are returned in the changes array.
     * The default, `main_only`, will only return the current "winning" revision; all_docs will return all leaf revisions
     * (including conflicts and deleted former conflicts).
     * @param {number} [params.timeout] - Query parameter to specify the maximum period in milliseconds to wait for a
     * change before the response is sent, even if there are no results. Only applicable for `longpoll` or `continuous`
     * feeds. Default value is specified by `httpd/changes_timeout` configuration option. Note that `60000` value is also
     * the default maximum timeout to prevent undetected dead connections.
     * @param {string} [params.view] - Query parameter to specify a view function as a filter. Documents pass the filter
     * if the view's map function emits at least one record for them.

     * instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the supplied
     * argument.
     *
     * It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:

     * of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
     * * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query selectors
     * use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce the number
     * of documents that will need to be scanned.

         *    * Be structured as valid JSON.
         *    * Contain a valid query expression.
         *
         *  Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
         *  option if filtering on document attributes only.
         *
         *  Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
         *  those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
         *
         *  Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
         *
         *  There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
         *  * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
         *  combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
         *  * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
         *  instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the
         *  supplied argument.
         *
         *  It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
         *  * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the
         *  basis of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query
         *  selectors use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce
         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.
         *
         *  See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
         *  combination and conditional operators.

         *  The selector object must:
         *    * Be structured as valid JSON.
         *    * Contain a valid query expression.
         *
         *  Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
         *  option if filtering on document attributes only.
         *
         *  Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
         *  those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
         *
         *  Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
         *
         *  There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
         *  * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
         *  combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
         *  * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
         *  instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the
         *  supplied argument.
         *
         *  It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
         *  * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the
         *  basis of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query
         *  selectors use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce
         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.
         *
         *  See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
         *  combination and conditional operators.

         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query

         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.

         *  The selector object must:
         *    * Be structured as valid JSON.
         *    * Contain a valid query expression.
         *
         *  Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
         *  option if filtering on document attributes only.
         *
         *  Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
         *  those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
         *
         *  Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
         *
         *  There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
         *  * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
         *  combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
         *  * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
         *  instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the
         *  supplied argument.
         *
         *  It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
         *  * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the
         *  basis of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query
         *  selectors use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce
         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.
         *
         *  See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
         *  combination and conditional operators.
         *
         *  For further reference see [selector syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-selector-syntax).

         *  The selector object must:
         *    * Be structured as valid JSON.
         *    * Contain a valid query expression.
         *
         *  Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
         *  option if filtering on document attributes only.
         *
         *  Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
         *  those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
         *
         *  Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
         *
         *  There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
         *  * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
         *  combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
         *  * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
         *  instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the
         *  supplied argument.
         *
         *  It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
         *  * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the
         *  basis of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query
         *  selectors use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce
         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.
         *
         *  See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
         *  combination and conditional operators.
         *

         *  The selector object must:
         *    * Be structured as valid JSON.
         *    * Contain a valid query expression.
         *
         *  Using a selector is significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter function, and is the recommended
         *  option if filtering on document attributes only.
         *
         *  Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the corresponding values required for
         *  those fields. You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
         *
         *  Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign `$` prefix in the name field.
         *
         *  There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
         *  * Combination operators: applied at the topmost level of selection. They are used to combine selectors. A
         *  combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another selector, or an array of selectors.
         *  * Condition operators: are specific to a field, and are used to evaluate the value stored in that field. For
         *  instance, the basic `$eq` operator matches when the specified field contains a value that is equal to the
         *  supplied argument.
         *
         *  It is important for query performance to use appropriate selectors:
         *  * Only equality operators such as `$eq`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, and `$lte` (but not `$ne`) can be used as the
         *  basis of a query. You should include at least one of these in a selector.
         *  * Some operators such as `$not`, `$or`, `$in`, and `$regex` cannot be answered from an index. For query
         *  selectors use these operators in conjunction with equality operators or create and use a partial index to reduce
         *  the number of documents that will need to be scanned.
         *
         *  See [the Cloudant Docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-operators)for a list of all available
         *  combination and conditional operators.
         *
